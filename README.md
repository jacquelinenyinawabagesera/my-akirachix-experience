A website highlighting my first week at AkiraChix

The project is created using HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) for inline-styling the webpage. The website is created using semantic html tags and block, inline and also empty elements and it also has the images folder.

How the project was coded

Started by creating and cloning a github repository and it was opened in an IDE(Integrated Development Environment) which is visual studio code.

Created files index.html and image folder

Started coding inside the index.html to start coding I used a boiler plate to start coding in the index.html file

Used semantic html tags to divide my html into different different sections
Examples of semantic tags used

<header></header>
<main></main>
<section></section>
<footer></footer>

Inside the semantic elements I used block elements inline elements and empty elements and added contents.

Block elements used

<p></p>
<h2></h2>
<h1></h1>
<div></div>
<ol></ol>
<ul></ul>
<li></li>

Inline elements
<br>

Empty elements
<img>
